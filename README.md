# Hospital Management System
The project Hospital Management system includes registration of patients, storing their details into the system, and also booking their appointments with doctors. Our software has the facility to give a unique id for every patient and stores the details of every patient and the staff automatically. User can search availability of a doctor and the details of a patient using the id. The Hospital Management System can be accessed using a valid username and password. The interface is visually appealing and very user-friendly. The data are well protected for personal use and makes the data processing very fast.

It is having mainly four modules, that are Admin, Doctor, Patient, Receptionist. The Application maintains authentication in order to access the application. Administrator task includes managing doctor’s information, patient’s information and receptionist’s information. To achieve this aim, a database was designed for patient, receptionist and doctor which the admin can access. The complaints which are given by user will be referred by authorities. Patient modules include checking appointments and booking appointments same goes for receptionist module. Receptionist module is used because if the patient is not well versed with computers or lack knowledge, then receptionist can help them in booking an appointment as well checking availability of doctors as well.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
